## What is Neuralchemy?

Neuralchemy focuses on creating production-grade tools and frameworks in the AI and developer infrastructure space.

Projects in this organization are designed to be:
- Stable and maintainable  
- Security-focused  
- Well-documented  
- Built for long-term use  

Experimental and fast-moving ideas are developed separately in Neuralchemy Labs.

## Philosophy

- Build carefully  
- Design for failure  
- Think long-term  
- Ship what matters  

Neuralchemy is not about chasing trends — it’s about building tools that last.
